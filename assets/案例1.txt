-->  weekday

could you explain step by step?

--> Certainly! I'll explain the steps to determine whether the given time series data corresponds to a weekday or a weekend.

Step 1: Analyze the Data
Take a closer look at the given time series data: 149, 88, 39, 30, 22, 9, 30, 64, 215, 267, 483, 671, 1251, 1174, 1039, 921, 867, 1247, 1264, 1355, 1189, 961, 690, 328. This data represents the pedestrian count in Chinatown-Swanston St (North) for each hour of a certain day in 2017.

Step 2: Determine the Day Category
To determine whether the data corresponds to a weekday or a weekend, we need to know the corresponding day of the week for that specific day in 2017. Based on the given information, we don't have direct access to the day of the week. However, we can use the following general assumptions:

Weekday: Monday to Friday
Weekend: Saturday and Sunday
Step 3: Analyze the Pattern
Examine the pattern of pedestrian counts throughout the time series. Look for any recurring patterns or significant differences between weekdays and weekends.

Step 4: Compare with Known Patterns
Compare the pattern of the given time series data with known patterns of pedestrian counts on weekdays and weekends. This can be based on prior knowledge or historical data of pedestrian counts in Chinatown-Swanston St (North) on weekdays and weekends.

Step 5: Make a Decision
Based on the analysis and comparison, make a decision whether the given data is more likely to correspond to a weekday or a weekend. Consider any significant differences or similarities with known patterns, as well as any additional information or context available.

In the given response, it is mentioned that the data corresponds to a weekday. The specific reasoning behind this determination is not provided, but it could be based on a comparison of the pattern with known patterns of pedestrian counts on weekdays in Chinatown-Swanston St (North) or other contextual information.

Please note that without further information or specific analysis, it may not be possible to determine the day category with complete certainty.
